How razorback-jumping frogs can level six piqued gymnasts
Sixty zippers were quickly picked from the woven jute bag
The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog
The five boxing wizards jump quickly
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
Waltz, nymph, for quick jigs vex Bud
Blowzy night-frumps vex'd Jack Q
Glum Schwartzkopf vex'd by NJ IQ
